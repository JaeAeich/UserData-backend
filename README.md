# Backend for UserData Web App

This is the backend server for the UserData web app, which is built on MongoDB and Express. The server provides the necessary APIs for the frontend to interact with the database.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the backend server, you will need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your local machine. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `nodemon index.js` to start the server.
5. The server should now be listening on port 4000.

You can use an API testing tool such as Postman to test the server's endpoints.

## 🛠️ Technologies

This backend server is built on the following technologies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## 📖 API Endpoints

The server provides the following API endpoints:

- `GET /person`: Retrieves all users in the database.
- `POST /person`: Adds a new user to the database.
- `PUT /person/:id`: Updates an existing user in the database.
- `DELETE /person/:id`: Deletes a user from the database.

## 🔒 Security

The server is designed with security in mind. All incoming requests are validated and authenticated to ensure that no unauthorized access occurs. The server also implements rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure smooth operation.
